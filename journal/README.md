# Virtual Camera with OBS

Due to COVID and online classes, I started to use OBS to make my camera’s output presentable. The common features for OBS are the customizable attachments that can be added to record a video and a virtual camera that acts as a selectable camera option.

After opening up the application, the OBS interface left me confused at first. My experience with recording/studio applications was phone applications that left me with the **mental model** that the features would be at the top. For OBS, the features lie at the bottom of the page.

As I was still confused, I looked for a section that would help me understand what I was looking at. I looked at the sources box and read its description.

Since there were no other indications of what to do, I clicked on the + button to see what the term “sources” meant to OBS.

The sources tab showed all of the processing features that could be added. After seeing all of the options, the application became more **learnable** as the titles hold onto specific features instead of putting every process into one tab. I clicked out of the pop-up and looked at the layout of OBS again. The layout of the features demonstrates a **match between the system and the real world** through **conventions**, such as **natural mapping** of a studio or recording session and a flow chart layout. 

I clicked on the + button of the sources tab again to add my camera. I kept clicking okay until I saw a change within the application.

After that, I changed my camera settings and filters by right-clicking on the camera tab. To make my camera be seen as a selectable camera device, I clicked on “Start Virtual Camera”.

The first initial problem when looking at the OBS application is the lack of guidance on what to do. The entire application being gray makes it hard to know what is going on. A solution can be a small tutorial or a colorful indicator to guide first-time users. It could bring attention since the original layout is gray.
